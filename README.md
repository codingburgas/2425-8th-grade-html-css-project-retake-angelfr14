    ## ðŸ“š About This Project

This website was developed as a personal project to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive web design. It simulates a modern burger restaurant website, featuring a dynamic menu, interactive location maps, and dedicated pages for contact and information. The goal was to build a clean, user-friendly interface optimized for various devices and demonstrate a comprehensive static website build.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Dynamic Hero Section:** Engaging video background with overlaid content.
* **Intuitive Navigation:** Clear and easy-to-use navigation menu, including a language selector dropdown.
* **Menu:** Categories and descriptions for various burger and side options.
* **Interactive Locations:** Map integration and detailed store information.
* **"About Us" Page:** Shares the restaurant's story, mission, and values.
* **"Contact Us" Page:** Provides a contact form, direct contact details, and social media links.
* **Themed Design:** Consistent color palette (red, brown, white) reflecting the brand.
* **Font Awesome Icons:** Used for navigation, social media, and informational elements.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Structure and content.
* **CSS3:** Styling and layout, including Flexbox and Grid for responsiveness.
* **Google Fonts:** Custom typography (`Lobster`, `Satisfy`, `Roboto`).
* **Font Awesome:** Vector icons for UI elements.

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/fresh-burgers-website.git](https://github.com/your-username/fresh-burgers-website.git)
    ```
    (Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `fresh-burgers-website` with your actual repo name)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd fresh-burgers-website
    ```

3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    Simply double-click the `index.html` file in your file explorer, or open it using a live server extension in your code editor (e.g., Live Server for VS Code).

    * **Note:** For the contact form to actually send emails, you would need a backend server configured to handle form submissions (e.g., using Node.js, Python, PHP). This frontend project does not include backend functionality.

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

* Explore the navigation bar to visit different sections of the website.
* Hover over the "EN" button in the navigation to change the displayed language (Note: actual language translation is a frontend placeholder; backend integration would be required for full functionality).
* View the dynamic hero section on the home page.
* Check out the menu, locations, and read about our story.
